[g:02] The Ocean of Storms is living up to its name.
[g:03] Defenders, erect wards upon transmat.
[g:04] Strikers, shelter under wards or whatever cover you can find until our Firebreak friends fall back.

[g:06] All right. Let's give the Hive some hell!

ASSOCIATIONS: Light; Omnigul; Wormrot
//AUDIO PRESERVED//
//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/

[y:01] I raised her 43 times. But on the 44th death, Omnigul's wormrot clung to her bones, rendered my powers useless on her.
[y:02] Now my Light is fading. But if there's a chance to revive her, I won't leave her. I won't…

PARTIES: Three [3]. One [1] Guardian-type, Class Warlock, designate Eriana-3 [e3]; One [1] Guardian-type, Class Hunter, designate Eris Morn [em]; One [1] Guardian-type, Class Hunter, designate Sai Mota [sm]
ASSOCIATIONS: Crota; Eriana-3; God [Hive]; Moon [Earth]; Morn, Eris; Mota, Sai
//AUDIO UNAVAILABLE//
//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/

[sm:01] So, driven by the words of an exiled madman and a desire for revenge, you are planning a forbidden attack by half a dozen people in an interdiction zone where thousands of Guardians were killed, and that plan is to kill a god. Did I get that right?
[e3:01] Yes.
[em:01] Yes.
[sm:02] Good. I'm in.

# Ghost Fragment: Gimble-4's Ghost

TYPE: LIVE COMBAT FEED [CONTINGENCY RECORD]

ASSOCIATIONS: Adonna; Akka; Song; Eir; Ur; Xol; Yul

[j:01] We're going in, getting what Adonna wanted, and getting out. Do you copy?
[j:02] …Hey. You listening?
[g4:01] Eir… Ur… Xol… Yul… Eir… Ur… Xol… Yul…
[j:03] What are you doing? Hey—
[g4:02] EIR. UR. XOL. YUL. AKKA!
[j:04] Ahhh—


TYPE: LIVE SURVEILLANCE FEED [CONTINGENCY-LINKED]
PARTIES: Two [2]. One [1] Research-type, Crypto-Archaeologist [Reef], designate Adonna [a]; One [1] Guardian-type, Class Titan, designate Gimble-4 [g4]
ASSOCIATIONS: Engram; Graphemics; Hive; Music; Paracausal; Quantum Field Theory; Relativity; Runes; Song
//AUDIO UNAVAILABLE//
//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/

[a:01] Engram precepts—not just prototypical but in sum—could be cynosural of a recondite gestalt. Procuring a modal sample from the Hive and comparing it to their runic syntax might be key to its graphemics and, ultimately, ambages to the protological patterns underlying quantum field theory, relativity, and paracausal phenomena.
[silence]
[a:02] A comparative study of Hive hymnody and graphonomy might—as part of a larger cerebrative process examining engrams through the window of fundamental theories of reality—reveal an ungirding pattern of tonal morphemes that…
[a:03] Hmm.
[silence]
[a:04] Both causal and paracausal laws of the universe might… share a common… language. Getting a sample of the Hive's… music… will help me… study it.
[silence]
[g4:01] So, you want us to record the Hive singing so you can…
[g4:02] …figure out how the universe works?
[a:05] Eureka! You apprehend it!

[em:01] No! I'll find a way to hide you, to hide your Light…
[b:01] There's no other way.
[em:02] Don't ask me to do this.
[b:02] Just promise me one thing.
[em:03] Ghost… please…
[b:03] Don't look back.

[em:01] What have I done?
[b:01] No time! Run!
[chorus:01] Eir… Ur… Xol… Yul…
[b:02] The song! Don't listen!
[b:03] Think of something else!
[em:02] I can't!
[b:04] Think of Sai Mota!
[em:03] Sai, I'm sorry.
[chorus:02] Eir… Ur… Xol… Yul…
[b:05] Think of Omar Agah!
[em:04] Oh, Omar…
[b:06] Think about Vell!
[em:05] Vell…
[b:07] Think about Eriana!
[em:06] Eriana!

[em:13] SAI! OMAR! VELL! ERIANA!

# Ghost Fragment: Toland's Ghost

TYPE: LIVE COMBAT FEED [CONTINGENCY RECORD]
PARTIES: One [1]. One [1] Ghost-type, designate Guren [g]
ASSOCIATIONS: Deathsinger; Guren [self]; Toland [AKA Toland, the Shattered]; Traveler
//AUDIO PRESERVED//
//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/

[g:01] This is the final transmission of Guren, Ghost of Toland whom you call the Shattered. He goes to hear the song of death.
[g:02] Nothing will deter him. None of you can stop him. Not anymore.
[g:03] Toland will hear the Deathsinger's melody. He will redefine death, escape the Traveler's blunt samsara.
[g:04] He will sound the depths of the powers you so myopically fear.
[g:05] My only regret is that I will not live to see his triumph.


TYPE: LIVE SURVEILLANCE FEED [CONTINGENCY-LINKED]
PARTIES: Two [2]. One [1] Ghost-type, designate Guren [g]; One [1] Guardian-type, Class Warlock, designate Toland [t]
ASSOCIATIONS: Eriana-3; Guardian; Morn, Eris; Toland [AKA Toland, the Shattered]
//AUDIO UNAVAILABLE//
//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/

[g:01] Incoming Guardians! They've broken the perimeter. Shall I engage defenses?
[t:01] No need. They have inquisitive intentions. If murder was their mission, we'd have lost our Light long ago.
[g:02] They want to know what you know.
[t:02] Yes. And I will tell them, but they will never understand. I'll greet them with a smile and welcome them in.
[t:03] I will learn how we can benefit from their ignorance.
[g:03] Yes, but don't smile.
[t:04] Why not? A smile hides the true purpose of teeth.
[g:04] Yes, but not yours.

[o:01] Vyhar, behind me!
[v:01] Just a sec!
[v:02] There! That'll give them something—
[ru:01] Watch out!
[v:03] Damn Incendiors!
[o:02] I told you—
[ru:02] Heads up! 
[v:04] What in the…?
[ru:03] Is that Ghaul?
[o:03] Gladiators incoming!
[v:05] That's got them riled up!
[g:01] Traveler, do you see me now?
[v:06] He's huge!
[ru:04] He has the Light!
[o:04] Impossible!
[g:02] I am immortal—a god!
[o:05] Listen to them cheering.
[ru:05] We've lost.
[g:03] You have failed!
[o:06] The plan didn't work.
[g:04] Witness the dawning of a new age!
[ru:06] Wait! Something's happening!
[g:05] Noooooooooo!

# Ghost Fragment: Lonesome Ghost

PARTIES: One [1]. One [1] Ghost-type, designate undesignated [u]
ASSOCIATIONS: First Light; Light; Luna [AKA Moon; Earth]; Reef
//AUDIO PRESERVED//
//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/

[u:01] This will be my last transmission. Not sure I even have the Light left to send it.
[u:02] Thought I'd look for a Guardian on Luna. A First Light colonist. A downed Reef pilot. Maybe an Exo who never came home from the war.
[u:03] Is it possible… to miss someone… you've never met?


TYPE: CANDIDATE SCAN [CONTINGENCY-LINKED]
PARTIES: One [1]. One [1] Ghost-type, designate undesignated [u]
ASSOCIATIONS: First Light
//AUDIO UNAVAILABLE//
//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/

[u:01] Finally! Another First Light technician.
[u:02] All right, let's see about you…
[u:03] Hoo boy. Another one.
[u:04] DNA degradation alone makes this impossible, but even if I could bring you back, who'd put you back together again?
[u:05] Inextirpable psychological trauma. Indelible psychosis: violence, paranoia, obsessive behavior. And… yup, some kind of hallucinatory mechanism. Damage to the occipital lobe and limbic, and then those weird formations in the parietal and temporal. It's like something rewired your brain but did it through your DNA.
[u:06] What were they doing up here?

# Ghost Fragment: Omar Agah's Ghost

[k:03] Omar… do you think… we'll see each other… again?


TYPE: LIVE SURVEILLANCE FEED [CONTINGENCY-LINKED]

//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/

[oa:01] You can't be serious.
[silence]
[oa:02] You are. But why?
[silence]
[oa:03] Dying up there won't bring her back, you know.
[silence]
[oa:04] Sorry. That wasn't… I'm sorry. Sometimes I say—
[e3:01] You're honest, Omar. It's a quality I very much admire. So, allow me to be honest in return.
[e3:02] We're going back, because we have found a way to destroy Crota. The Vanguard is too cowardly to use it.
[oa:05] Cowardly?
[e3:03] You know it's true. We hide behind the Wall as if it would save us, but what if Crota decided to descend?
[e3:04] What if Crota and his armies landed in the City? How many more would die?
[oa:06] But if Crota were to attack us, couldn't we defeat him here?
[e3:05] No. The only means of destroying him is up there.
[oa:07] Then why won't the Vanguard agree to—
[e3:06] Eris and I went to Toland—
[oa:08] Eris? Eris Morn?
[e3:07] She sent me.
[oa:09] Why the hell didn't you just say so? Let's go.

[j:01] I'll keep the feed live. Maybe the Praxics can make use of this data.
[j:02] It's a song that's killing her. Gone on for about two minutes, thirty seconds now.
[j:03] I've wiped it from this transmission, in case its power extends through recorded media.
[j:04] If anyone is listening… don't trust Toland.

[e3:02] Eris?…You made it.
[em:02] I did. I wish more could say the same.
[silence]
[e3:03] You want something to drink?
[e3:04] You sure? On the house tonight.
[em:03] I'm sure.
[silence]
[e3:05] You know, this is where we…
[em:04] I know.
[e3:06] When she laughed, the dishes would rattle. You remember that?
[em:05] I remember.
[e3:07] Now, it's so damn quiet…
[e3:08] EVERYBODY'S TOO DAMN QUIET!
[e3:09] LAUGH!
[e3:10] LAUGH, DAMN IT!
[silence]
[e3:11] Somebody, just laugh…

[e3:12] I… I just miss her so much…

//AUDIO UNAVAILABLE//
//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/

[oa:01] Hang on, does it make sense to you that Crota will be weaker in some reality he created?
[vt:01] It doesn't have to make sense. He just has to be stopped.
[oa:02] I know, but wouldn't you make a netherworld or whatever where you were invulnerable?
[vt:02] According to Toland—
[oa:03] Right, Toland. Why are we trusting anything that lunatic says?
[vt:03] I don't trust him. His highest loyalty is to knowledge. I trust you. I trust Eris and the others. I trust the Light in us.
[oa:04] A lot of Guardians brought their Light here. Are we any different?
[vt:04] They didn't know what Toland knows.
[oa:05] Toland again!
[vt:05] Toland again. I don't trust my weapons. I use them.
[silence]
[oa:06] Fair enough.
