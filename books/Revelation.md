"Come on. Don't you see how momentous this is? Can't you feel it? We're on the Moon mining for what might be—"

"Above my pay grade. I dig. You dig. Let's dig."

"Slow down! Listen. A science only just discovered and a source on that wavelength or whatever is buried in the crust of the Moon. There's a whole other mission serving as a cover story! This is huge!"

"Just another day at the office."

"On the Moon..."

"Yep. On the Moon. Now come on. Get your gear and mount up."

"What's the hurry? It's just another day at the office."

"Commander, we found it."

"Where?"

"Nearly twelve hundred meters deep in Site 3. The readings were all over the charts like in the other dig sites, but the borer broke into a tunnel and… Well, we almost hit it with the borer. The machine chewed through a pillar or something that held it up, and—" 

"It? So what is it? What does it look like? Show me the feed, the diagnostics, everything." 

"I don't have any of that." 

"What?"

"That's why I'm here. Instruments failed the moment we broke through. The borer too."

"Some sort of EMP? But your suits—"

"Worked just fine. We checked and rechecked everything." 

"So what is this thing?"

"Nothing like what I expected. You have to see it for yourself."

"I think I do."

"I'll help you get your suit on."

"I've completed the report, Commander. You can read it for yourself, but I think we both understand the gravity of the situation."

"I will read it—and share a sitrep with the board next quarter—but a summary of principle findings wouldn't be out of order."

"[yawn] Excuse me. I need to get some rest. Well, I can't explain the mechanism, but tests show neurochemical cascades increasing in frequency and severity over time. Individuals differ in their expression, but there's a clear trend when examined in the aggregate. Approximately eighty percent of the K1 crew is suffering similarly: intrusive thoughts, insomnia, narcolepsy, nightmares, and in the worst cases—as we saw with Helsha Rell—hallucinations, auditory and visual. It's a threat to the project."

"And the twenty percent?"

"Individuals who've yet to be exposed. And yes, before you ask, I did witness the effect in action. I took the levels on an unexposed technician, Keleen Vance, and reexamined them after just an hour with it. Despite no outward changes of behavior, there was a marked drop in her serotonin and a commensurate rise in cortisol. After a week of work at Site 3, she was requesting sedatives as a sleep aid. Now she wants something stronger. Something to knock her out."

"Does your report include any recommendations?"

"Only my best guess: Restrict direct exposure to thirty minutes per day, rotate teams between sites each week to limit proximity. And we need to plan for attrition. People need to get off this rock or they'll go crazy. Heck, I'm near the breaking point, and I'm supposed to help everyone else."

"I think you're right. You do need a break. Come with me when I head back to Earth for my next quarterly. We can come up with a plan for who will replace you in the coming days."

"Fine. [yawns] Fine. And my recommendations?"

"I'll review the report, and we'll implement them. The rotation between sites will cause difficulty, but we'll do what we must to keep the crew fit."

"Yeah. It's a new pattern. That seemed super interesting two hours ago, but it got old. I am bored, and I am tired. And when our shift is over, I probably won't be able to sleep until two hours before I have to get up and do it all over again."

"Look at where the signal is coming from."

"What do you mean? It's right in front of us."

"Check the ambit on the PQZ."

"That's weird."

"Uh huh."

"So it's an echo?"

"Well the pattern repeats. First from here. And then from out there."

"So you think it's bouncing the signal off something outside the system? You're crazy."

"Nothing…" [whistles]

"Hopefully we're laughing about it now.

"Anyway, I'm recording this because I was invited to do… well, a super-special and super-secret job. So secret that I can't send you any messages while I'm away.

"But I'm going to record something every day because I'll be thinking about you every day. And Mimi, too, but I have different messages for her.

"Mama is on the Moon! I'm sure you'll know that by the time we listen to this, but still, it's so crazy! It was long trip, and I'm exhausted, but now that I'm here I can't sleep. Too excited, I guess.

"Anyway, they found something up here on the Moon. It's a… Well, no one really knows what it is, but it's talking to something way out there. It might be talking to another Traveler! And that's what I'm here to help figure out. They needed Mama to help them crack the code. Pretty cool, right?

"Don't you think that might be a little over the top?"

"I... [sigh] Sorry. I didn't sleep well last night. I'm…"

"On edge? Yes. You hide it well, but I've been studying this. I know the signs. Insomnia or nightmares, or both?"

"Neither. I was awake. I was reading a report in bed, and then suddenly someone was in the room with me."

"A hallucination. Someone you knew?"

"Someone I knew? No. No, it was just a figure. I looked at the foot of my bed, and it was like a person, but tall, too tall. It loomed over me, a shadow. I couldn't see any features. I tried to call out to it, but I couldn't speak. I couldn't move. And it just looked at me. It sounds crazy, but it felt hateful—or not hate exactly… disdain? Anyway, I must have lost consciousness because when I woke, it was gone."

"This was the first occurrence? Just last night?"

"Yes. I can't imagine experiencing that twice."

"Well, I have good news and bad news."

[unintelligible grumble]

"Now hang on. It's really just good news. The bad news is that those who suffer from what you experienced often report multiple occurrences. The good news is that it's totally natural, it aligns with my research, and I think I can help you avoid it in the future."

"So what was it?"

"'It' was predormital sleep paralysis—atonia while conscious. You just need a little more gamma-aminobutyric acid in your system. Your body was in a sleep state while your mind was awake. This causes stress and can result in that idea of a threat being in the room. I'll send something up to your quarters. Drink it an hour before bed, and you'll be fine."

"That's a relief. Thank you, Doctor Henson. Forgive me for earlier?"

"Don't worry about it, but you might want to have another word with Jun."

This project has been difficult. No one could have predicted how hard it has been. Our health has suffered. Our families have suffered. We've lost friends. And every day you are here, each and every one of you is making a personal sacrifice.

I know you understand that what we're learning is worth that sacrifice. But I also know that it's frustrating to not be certain that our work is making a difference. So I asked you all to come together today to tell you: You're not just making a difference; you're changing our stars.

Not far from here, a man took the first step onto the Moon saying it was "one giant leap for mankind." Now, because of you, humanity is making its next giant leap.

Today, in a message that will be relayed system-wide, Aeronautics of China is announcing a new phase of the Exodus project. The science we invented will be used to propel humanity beyond our solar system and to new worlds.

(Pause for applause)

Construction of the new colony ships has already begun. 

(Pause for applause)

Some of you might want to join those missions. I know you all have the right stuff. (Pause for laughter?) But I hope you'll consider staying. Our work here is invaluable. We're here taking our small steps so that humanity can take ever greater leaps.

Thank you.

"How about—"

"How about what's happening here? How about everything being messed up? How about killing them all!"

"What are you talking about?"

"I tried! Tried to get to the other station. To get the word out. To let somebody know we did something wrong. But they're all dead! They're dead!"

"Who's dead?"

"EVERYONE! EVERYONE ON THE SURFACE IS DEAD! WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING TO ME? WHY WON'T ANYONE LISTEN TO ME?"

"Okay! Okay… I believe you. Just… it's hard to understand. What exactly did you see?"

"I'm not staying here."

"She's made her decision, doctor. Just so we're all clear: Our first order of business is making contact with any survivors."

"There's nobody left."

"You say that, Jun, but we can't know for sure until we check. What you say you saw was terrible, but—"

"I saw it."

"She saw it. But she didn't see everything. The point is we have to be sure, and the second thing we're going to do is try to learn what happened. If, as Commander Kuang believes—"

"Industrial espionage? Not a chance."

"Then we'll figure it out. The third order of business is delivering what evidence we find and Firewall's datastack to Rasputin. Once we secure a signal and transmit, we'll call for aid and find a way to get off this rock. Contact, investigate, transmit, escape."
